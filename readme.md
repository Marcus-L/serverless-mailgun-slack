# Serverless-Mailgun-Slack

If you've got a small personal slack setup that you don't want to pay for upgrading to a paid tier, but would like an email integration, this is a quick and _almost_ free way to go (it might cost you a few pennies a month). Implemented as an AWS Lambda NodeJS function and Serverless Web API configuration for posting notifications to Slack when triggered by Mailgun incoming mail routes. 

## Prerequisites

* You should have an AWS Account. Sign up, it's free!
* You should have a Mailgun Account. Also free to sign up.
* Do you have a Slack account? There's a free tier.
* NodeJS and Serverless (`npm install -g serverless`)
* Serverless depends on AWS-CLI, so if you haven't already, install it and do an `aws-cli configure` ([details](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/setup/)).

## Installation

* Get the source: `git clone https://github.com/Marcus-L/serverless-mailgun-slack.git`
* Install dependencies: `cd src` and `npm install`

* ### Enter keys into src/handler.js
```
// configuration
const MAILGUN_KEY = "key-.....";
const SLACKHOOK_URL = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/.....";
```
The Mailgun API Key can be found on your [account settings](https://mailgun.com/app/account/security) page. You can set up a Slack Incoming Webhook from the [apps page](https://slack.com/apps). Don't mind the channel/name/icon, it's overridden in handler.js.

* Deploy: `serverless deploy`
* Make a note of the POST endpoint that was generated (https://....amazonaws.com/dev/post)

### Configure Mailgun routes 
You get a free sandbox domain with Mailgun, but you could also use a custom domain if you set it up. Set up a route as follows:
* Match Recipient (I use a random GUID as the word, but you could use something like "slack", etc): `^[any word]\\+(.*)@[your domain]$`, example: `^38cf11c2084246a49ce0279ff9080f23\+(.*)@sandbox15dc133ed03147c4a8d91029a1e4e0a3.mailgun.org$`
* Store and notify: checked -  `https://.....amazonaws.com/dev/post` (the POST URL of your serverless deploy)
* Stop: checked

## Usage
The handler.js code parses the email address and uses the part after the `+` as the channel to post into. Ex: foo+general@yourdomain.com would post into the #general channel.

The message in slack will include the sender, subject and plaintext of the email. Customize the handler.js as you see fit! Send a test email to your mailgun address and enjoy the instant notification to your slack channel.
